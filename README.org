* Simulator configuration for Machinekit mkwrapper

To start this configuration either use run =run.py= or start
=mklauncher= with this directory as search path.

The default search path for announced user interfaces is
=~/repos/Cetus=. To add an alternative search path use =./run.py -p
<search_path>=. Configserver scans the directory recursively.
